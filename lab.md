### Part 2: Practice Regex Through Games!

There are many gamified ways to practice and learn Regex. We will use two for this lab:

- [Regex Crossword](https://regexcrossword.com/), which has many Regex puzzles of varying difficulty. 
- [Regex Golf](https://alf.nu/RegexGolf), which tests your ability to write precise Regex.

I have also created an app for this event, Redoku (located in the [Redoku](https://github.com/GoldinGuy/UltimateRegexResource/tree/master/RedokuRN) folder of this repo. Redoku is a simple React Native application that allows you to hone your Regex skills through sudoku-like puzzles (much like Regex crossword). This was heavily based on [redoku](https://github.com/padolsey/redoku), an awesome website with the same name. Thank you to [@padolsey](https://github.com/padolsey) for granting permission to use the name "Redoku!" Download it below!

#### The Ultimate Challenge

If you're really ready to put your Regex skills to the test, feel free to attempt [@gregable's](https://github.com/Gregable/regexp-puzzle) [Ultimate Regex Puzzle](https://gregable.com/2015/12/regular-expression-crossword-puzzle.html), which was initially part of [MIT's 2013 Mystery Puzzle Hunt](http://www.mit.edu/activities/puzzle/2013/). 
While effectively a much more difficult version of the Redoku app or RegexCrossword, it will certainly be a strong indicator of your Regex prowess.
