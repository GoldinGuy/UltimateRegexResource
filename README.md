Regex, or [regular expressions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_expression), are patterns used to match strings. Regex is commonly used for searching/filtering strings for information, input validation, and web scraping. "Real world" examples include everything from validating email addresses to formatting class names in a grades app.

Regex is incredibly powerful, but due to its seemingly unintelligible nature it's also often intimidating to learn and difficult to remember.

For that reason, I've compiled a selection of the most helpful and commonly used regex syntax and some regex resources for your use below!

The [Redoku](https://github.com/GoldinGuy/UltimateRegexResource/tree/master/RedokuRN) folder of this repo contains the app ["Redoku,"](TODO:) a simple React Native application created for this event that allows you to hone your Regex skills through sudoku-like puzzles. This was heavily based on [redoku](https://github.com/padolsey/redoku), an awesome website with the same name. Thank you to [@padolsey](https://github.com/padolsey) for granting permission to use the name "Redoku!" You can download the app on [ios](TODO:) or [android](TODO:).

Anywhere used below, `char` is shorthand for `character` (letter, digit or symbol), and `exp` is shorthand for a `regular expression`.


### ‚úíÔ∏è "Balderdash" Basics (of Regex)

- Regular expressions start and end with "slash" characters `/`.
- Patterns return the first [case-sensitive](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Case_sensitivity) match they find by default.

Therefore: given the sample string `I scream, you scream, we all scream for ice cream`, `/scream/` matches the first instance of "scream."

This behavior can be modified with [flags](#-flags).

### üö© "Flapdoodle" Flags

| Syntax | Flag          | Behavior                                                       | Example  |
| ------ | ------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- | -------- |
| `g`    | _global_      | Returns additional matches                                     | `/foo/g` |
| `i`    | _insensitive_ | Allows case-insensitive matches                                | `/foo/i` |
| `x`    | _verbose_     | Ignore whitespace & allow comments                             | `/foo/x` |
| `u`    | _unicode_     | Expressions are treated as Unicode (UTF-16)                    | `/foo/u` |
| `s`    | _singleline_  | Treats entire string as one line (allows `.` to match newline) | `/foo/s` |
| `m`    | _multiline_   | Start & end anchors now trigger on each line                   | `/foo/m` |
| `n`    | _nth match_   | Matches text returned by _nth_ group                           | `/foo/m` |

Regex includes several flags that are appended to the end of the expression to change behavior. Using the string `I scream, you scream, we all SCREAM for ice cream`, the updated regex `/scream/gi` will now return `scream scream SCREAM`.

| `\`    | _escape_          | The following when preceding them: `[{()}].*+?$^/\` | `)$[]*{`       | `\[\]`             | `[]`          |

| Syntax | Substitute        | Behavior                      |

### üñäÔ∏è "Jargon" Quantifiers

| Syntax  | Quantifier | Matches                                     | Example String | Example Expression | Example Match |
| ------- | ---------- | ------------------------------------------- | -------------- | ------------------ | ------------- |
| `?`     | _optional_ | 0 or 1 of the preceding expression          | `ccc`          | `c?`               | `c`           |
| `{X}`   | _X_        | X of the preceding expression               | `ccc`          | `c{2}`             | `cc`          |
| `{X,}`  | _X+_       | X or more of the preceding expression       | `ccc`          | `c{2,}`            | `ccc`         |
| `{X,Y}` | _range_    | Between X and Y of the preceding expression | `ccc`          | `c{1,3}`           | `ccc`         |

Beyond standard quantifiers, there are a few additional modifiers: _greedy_, _lazy_, and _possessive_.

| Syntax | Quantifier      | Matches                                                                                      | Example String | Example Expression | Example Match |
| ------ | --------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------- | ------------------ | ------------- |
| `*`    | _0+ greedy_     | 0 or more of the preceding expression, using as many chars as possible                       | `abccc`        | `c*`               | `ccc`         |
| `+`    | _1+ greedy_     | 1 or more of the preceding expression, using as many chars as possible                       | `abccc`        | `c+`               | `ccc`         |
| `*?`   | _0+ lazy_       | 0 or more of the preceding expression, using as few chars as possible                        | `abccc`        | `c*?`              | `c`           |
| `+?`   | _1+ lazy_       | 1 or more of the preceding expression, using as few chars as possible                        | `abccc`        | `c+?`              | `c`           |
| `*+`   | _0+ possessive_ | 0 or more of the preceding expression, using as many chars as possible, without backtracking | `abccc`        | `c*+`              | `ccc`         |
| `++`   | _1+ possessive_ | 1 or more of the preceding expression, using as many chars as possible, without backtracking | `abccc`        | `c++`              | `ccc`         |

Put simply, greedy quantifiers match as much as possible, lazy as little as possible, and possessive as much as possible without backtracking.

What this means in practice is that possessive quantifiers will always return either the same match as greedy quantifiers, or if backtracking is required they will return no match. Therefore, posessive quantifiers should be used when you know backtracking is _not_ necessary, allowing increased performance.

| `\b`   | _word boundary_         | Between a character matched and not matched by `\w` | `she sells seasells` | `s\b`              | `s`           |

| `\Z`   | _multi-end_    | End of string                                      | `she sees cheese` | `\w+\Z`            | `cheese`      |
| `\Z`   | _absolute end_ | Absolute end of string, ignoring trailing newlines | `she sees cheese` | `\w+\Z`            | `cheese`      |
