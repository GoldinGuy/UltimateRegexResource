Regex, or [regular expressions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_expression), are patterns used to match strings. Regex is commonly used for searching/filtering strings for information, input validation, and web scraping. "Real world" examples include everything from validating email addresses to formatting class names in a grades app.

Regex is incredibly powerful, but it's also often intimidating to learn and difficult to remember.

For that reason, I've compiled a selection of the most helpful and commonly used regex syntax and some regex resources for your use below!

#### Notes

<!-- The [Docs](https://github.com/GoldinGuy/UltimateRegexResource/tree/main/docs) folder of this repo contains a simple profile/resume static site built on HTML5 and [TailwindCSS](https://v1.tailwindcss.com/) to help learn about [Github pages](https://pages.github.com/). You can clone the repository and test it out yourself, or visit [this link](https://goldinguy.github.io/UltimateRegexResource/) to see a live demo. For more info look at the [README](https://github.com/GoldinGuy/UltimateRegexResource/blob/main/docs/README.md) for the `/docs` directory. -->

### ‚úíÔ∏è Basics of Regex

- Regular expressions start and end with "slash" characters `/`.
- Patterns return the first [case-sensitive](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Case_sensitivity) match they find by default.

Therefore, given the sample string `red green blue BLUE blue`:

`/blue/` matches the first instance of "blue."

### üñãÔ∏è Flags

| Syntax | Flag          | Behavior                                                       |
| ------ | ------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `g`    | _global_      | Returns additional matches                                     |
| `i`    | _insensitive_ | Allows case-insensitive matches                                |
| `x`    | _verbose_     | Ignore whitespace & allow comments                             |
| `u`    | _unicode_     | Expressions are treated as Unicode (UTF-16)                    |
| `s`    | _singleline_  | Treats entire string as one line (allows `.` to match newline) |
| `m`    | _multiline_   | Start & end anchors now trigger on each line                   |

Regex includes several flags that are appended to the end of the expression to change behavior. Using the same string as before, the updated regex `/blue/gi` will now return `blue BLUE blue`.

### ‚úèÔ∏è Characters in a Regex Story

| Syntax | Character            | Matches                                                                                         | Example String | Example Expression | Example Match |
| ------ | -------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------- | ------------------ | ------------- |
| `.`    | _any_                | Literally any char _(except line break)_                                                        | `a-c1-3`       | `a.c`              | `a-c`         |
| `\w`   | _word_               | ASCII char _(Or Unicode char in Python & C#)_                                                   | `a-c1-3`       | `\w-\w`            | `a-c`         |
| `\d`   | _digit_              | Digit 0-9 _(Or Unicode digit in Python & C#)_                                                   | `a-c1-3`       | `\d-\d`            | `1-3`         |
| `\s`   | _whitespace_         | Space, tab, vertical tab, newline, carriage return _(Or Unicode seperator in Python, C#, & JS)_ | `a b`          | `a\sb`             | `a b`         |
| `\W`   | **NOT** _word_       | Anything `\w` does not match                                                                    | `a-c1-3`       | `\W-\W`            | `1-3`         |
| `\D`   | **NOT** _digit_      | Anything `\d` does not match                                                                    | `a-c1-3`       | `\D-\D`            | `a-c`         |
| `\S`   | **NOT** _whitespace_ | Anything `\s` does not match                                                                    | `a-c1-3`       | `\S-\S`            | `a-c`         |

### üñãÔ∏è Special Characters

| Syntax | Special Character | Matches                                                                                             | Example String | Example Expression | Example Match |
| ------ | ----------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------- | ------------------ | ------------- |
| `\`    | _escape_          | When placed before special chars, matches them. This includes the following chars: `[{()}].*+?$^/\` | `)$[]*{`       | `\[\]`             | `[]`          |

### üñåÔ∏è Quantifiers

| Syntax  | Quantifier | Matches                                     | Example String | Example Expression | Example Match |
| ------- | ---------- | ------------------------------------------- | -------------- | ------------------ | ------------- |
| `?`     | _optional_ | 0 or 1 of the preceding expression          | `ccc`          | `c?`               | `c`           |
| `{X}`   | _X_        | X of the preceding expression               | `ccc`          | `c{2}`             | `cc`          |
| `{X,}`  | _X+_       | X or more of the preceding expression       | `ccc`          | `c{2,}`            | `ccc`         |
| `{X,Y}` | _range_    | Between X and Y of the preceding expression | `ccc`          | `c{1,3}`           | `ccc`         |

Beyond standard quantifiers, there are a few additional modifiers: _greedy_, _lazy_, and _possessive_.

| Syntax | Quantifier      | Matches                                                                                      | Example String | Example Expression | Example Match |
| ------ | --------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------- | ------------------ | ------------- |
| `*`    | _0+ greedy_     | 0 or more of the preceding expression, using as many chars as possible                       | `abccc`        | `c*`               | `ccc`         |
| `+`    | _1+ greedy_     | 1 or more of the preceding expression, using as many chars as possible                       | `abccc`        | `c+`               | `ccc`         |
| `*?`   | _0+ lazy_       | 0 or more of the preceding expression, using as few chars as possible                        | `abccc`        | `c*?`              | `c`           |
| `+?`   | _1+ lazy_       | 1 or more of the preceding expression, using as few chars as possible                        | `abccc`        | `c+?`              | `c`           |
| `*+`   | _0+ possessive_ | 0 or more of the preceding expression, using as many chars as possible, without backtracking | `abccc`        | `c*+`              | `ccc`         |
| `++`   | _1+ possessive_ | 1 or more of the preceding expression, using as many chars as possible, without backtracking | `abccc`        | `c++`              | `ccc`         |

Put simply, greedy quantifiers match as much as possible, lazy as little as possible, and possessive as much as possible without backtracking.

What this means in practice is that possessive quantifiers will always return either the same match as greedy quantifiers, or if backtracking is required they will return no match. Therefore, posessive quantifiers should be used when you know backtracking is _not_ necessary, allowing increased performance.

### üñäÔ∏è Anchors

| Syntax | Anchor                  | Matches                                             | Example String       | Example Expression | Example Match |
| ------ | ----------------------- | --------------------------------------------------- | -------------------- | ------------------ | ------------- |
| `^`    | _start_                 | Start of string                                     | `she sells seasells` | `^\w+`             | `she`         |
| `$`    | _end_                   | End of string                                       | `she sells seasells` | `\w+$`             | `seashells`   |
| `\b`   | _word boundary_         | Between a character matched and not matched by `\w` | `she sells seasells` | `s\b`              | `s`           |
| `\B`   | **NOT** _word boundary_ | Between two characters matched by `\w`              | `she sells seasells` | `\w+$`             | `seashells`   |

There are additional anchors available that are unaffected by multiline mode `m`:

| Syntax | Anchor         | Matches                                            | Example String    | Example Expression | Example Match |
| ------ | -------------- | -------------------------------------------------- | ----------------- | ------------------ | ------------- |
| `\A`   | _multi-start_  | Start of string                                    | `she sees cheese` | `\A\w+`            | `she`         |
| `\Z`   | _multi-end_    | End of string                                      | `she sees cheese` | `\w+\Z`            | `cheese`      |
| `\Z`   | _absolute end_ | Absolute end of string, ignoring trailing newlines | `she sees cheese` | `\w+\Z`            | `cheese`      |
